        In this task, you will be provided two sentences, one of which is a rewritten version of the other.
        Your job is to determine whether the rewritten sentence is a paraphrase of the original sentence.
        Paraphrases are sentences that convey approximately the same meaning using different words; in other words, the two sentences don't have to mean exactly the same thing, but the important details should match.
        If the two sentences mean very different things, select the first choice, <strong style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">No paraphrase relationship</strong>.<br /><br />

        If the two sentences are paraphrases, you will be asked to also determine the grammaticality of the rewritten sentence.
        If the rewritten sentence contains serious grammatical errors that hurt its readability (you can overlook minor errors), select <strong style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Approximately the same meaning, but the rewritten sentence is ungrammatical</strong>.
        Finally, if the rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, select the third option, <strong style="color: rgb(0, 168, 133);">Approximately the same meaning and the rewritten sentence is grammatical.</strong><br /><br />

        Here are some examples:<br /></br />

        <strong style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">No paraphrase relationship</strong>:<br />

            original sentence:you want to sell the guns ?</br />
            rewritten sentence: where do you want the people ?</br />
            original sentence: please stay behind the barricade , ma'am .</br />
            rewritten sentence: please get on top of the roadblock , ma'am .</br /></br />

        <strong style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Approximately the same meaning, but the rewritten sentence is ungrammatical</strong>:<br />

            original sentence: these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers .</br />
            rewritten sentence: because these guys look great to have a beer with is just not funny artists .</br /></br />

        <strong style="color: rgb(0, 168, 133);">Approximately the same meaning and the rewritten sentence is grammatical</strong>:</br />

            original sentence: smithback looked around quickly , his eyes searching the deserted room .</br />
            rewritten sentence: smithback looked around quickly , scanning the deserted men's room .</br /></br />
