      "Extended Context:  This is characterised by a clinical/scientific approach (Iedema et al, 2006b) and an orientation towards a “lack view” of safety (Messman, 2009), that is, an approach that sees safety improvements stemming from the correction of organisational problems instead of, for instance, developing existing sources of resilience.We are also aware that RCA has been interpreted as an emerging form of self-surveillance (Waring, 2007) and potentially extending the principle of concertive control among healthcare practitioners (Iedema, 2006b).However, reflecting Vincent‟s (2009) exhortation that social science research should try to contribute positively to the cause  8 of patient safety (see also Iedema, 2009), our underlying focus is to explore whether within these limits the particular way in which RCA has been translated in practice in the UK risks stifling its potential to generate organisational learning and thus safer healthcare.\n",

      "Extended Context:  Similarly, though there is evidence that different modalities oftherapy may have different levels of effectiveness (see Tolin, 2010for a meta-analytic comparison of CBT with other therapies),where this does occur this appears to be more a quantitative thana qualitative difference.The outcomes of psychodynamic, person-centred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalentdespite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeu-tic change (Stiles et al., 2008; Budd and Hughes, 2009) perhapsbecause they work via common final paths (Mansell, 2011).Even treatments as different as CBT and pharmacotherapyappear to have broadly similar outcomes in, for example, depres-sion (DeRubeis et al., 2008) with no reliable evidence of thedifferential effects of CBT on negative cognitions or medicationon somatic symptoms as might have been expected from theirmechanisms of action.\n",

      "Extended Context:  Rose-Ackerman  (1997)  for example argues that corruption will always escalate to ever higher levels, and Kaufman and Wei (2000) find  that  in  economies  where  corruption  is  high  and  more  bribes  have  to  be  paid,  managers  end  up allocating more time to public officials and less time to productive work.A more recent and more rigorous study by Swaleheen (2011) shows that the ‘grease-in-the-wheel’ argument applies only in the cases of very high-corruption countries, and by Carden and Verdon (2010) only in the cases of low-freedom countries .Since such countries do not have fair elections and voter response to speak of, they do not fall under the subject matter of our paper.\n",
